## API Description

This API provides access to a database of second-hand vehicles, allowing users to query and manipulate vehicle information. It offers endpoints to retrieve vehicle details based on various criteria such as type, brand, price range, and years of usage. Additionally, users can add, update, and delete vehicle entries in the database.

## Advantages of GraphQL over REST API

In this project, GraphQL offers several advantages over REST APIs. It enables precise data retrieval, reduces network overhead, simplifies API management with a single endpoint, and facilitates seamless evolution of the API schema. These benefits make GraphQL a more efficient and flexible solution for handling vehicle information retrieval and manipulation.
